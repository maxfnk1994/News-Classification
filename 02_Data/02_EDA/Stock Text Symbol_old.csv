There are people in the entertainment industry, in the technical department, creative department, or to that matter event performers are an institution in themselves and still to maintain themselves is a task. We like it when we see Jeetendra well maintained but obviously he's out in a lot of hardwork to be like this. But a common man doesn't know the hardship he has been through.""

Not just the PM but the actor's daughter filmmaker Ekta Kapoor posted a picture of her father and the PM and wrote about their fan moment, she posted the picture and wrote, ""JAI HIND! My dad's fan moment !my dad is a big fan of the honorable prime minister n today he met him.""

It has, at times, worked miracles ? many claim Twitter and Facebook were integral in coordinating the Arab Spring, while the ubiquity of smartphones has allowed the documentation of human rights violations committed by dictators around the world (and in Syria in particular). But, it could be argued, these same technologies have done nothing to affirm the agency and humanity of those from marginalized and oppressed countries ? their photos and videos are co-opted by international media organizations (both those friendly and hostile) who use them to create their own narratives (both those truthful and not), and Facebook and Twitter do what they do to harvest data and sell ads.

Feeling the Love in February: The National Initiative for Arts & Health in the Military,"This February reflection takes me squarely into the midst of the incredible people working at the intersections of arts, health, and the military. One of the fastest growing networks at Americans for the Arts is the National Initiative for Arts & Health in the Military (NIAHM) Facebook Group. I am feeling the love for everyone who shares their programs and stories regularly in the NIAHM group, whose contributors represent a dynamic mix of individuals and organizations, state and local arts agencies, VA programs, arts and veterans service organizations?representing all branches of service, and all forms of art and art-making. Each day brings new postings of happenings across the country, new programs, new milestones, new art, and new inspirations. Our member postings run the gamut of understanding the deep historical roots of the arts in the military, to examples of how today?s veteran artists are carving out the unique history of the 21st century through their art. A sampling of the postings from just the last two weeks tells a rich story of the history and diversity of the arts as part of the military culture.

	What is my #reality?
		Media Literacy Day on Social Media and Globalization


Social media plays a decisive role in the digital everyday life of young people. Through the documentary THE CLEANERS, students are introduced to the topics of online censorship and filter bubbles, at a pedagogically guided film screening.
The film follows so-called ""content moderators"" who delete images and videos on the Internet on behalf of Facebook and Co. We learn what global effects this selection can have. Ultimately, it is about nothing less than the question of how our reality is shaped. Based on the film, the young people will be sensitized to globalization issues and learn to recognize the effects of social media.
	A project class of the Munich Theodolinden-Gymnasium, which has been dealing with the topic in depth since March, under the guidance of an expert in digital education, will present the results of its work. Together with an interactive survey, in which the pupils participate live on site via smartphone, this forms the basis for a discussion about their own use of social media.
From year 10 and for interested teachersTuesday, 14th May 2019, 08.30 to 11.45 a.m.
	HFF University of Television and Film Munich
	admission 3,00 ?, registration: education@dokfest-muenchen.de

VIDEO: Ted Green's Eva A-7063 screened at AMDOCS,"
Eva A-7063 a documentary film by Ted Green, Mika Brown and WFYI about Eva Mozes Kor?s story of survival in Auschwitz!.
 
As a 10-year-old ?Mengele Twin,? Eva Kor suffered some of the worst of the Holocaust. At 50, she launched the biggest manhunt in history. Now in her 80s, she circles the globe to promote the lesson her journey has taught: Healing through forgiveness.
 
Eva is a triumph of hope, and this film is her legacy piece. ""Eva is more than just a story,"" says actor Elliot Gould. ""She's a revelation of what's possible in the human condition.""
 
Narrated by Hollywood icon Ed Asner, ""Eva: A-7063"" tells the full, astonishing story of this historic figure for the first time, tracking her from Auschwitz to Israel to the United States - even into the U.S. Capitol for her jaw-dropping arrest - and ultimately to her courageous return to the Nazi death camp.
